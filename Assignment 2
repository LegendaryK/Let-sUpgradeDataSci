Question 1)
Ans:

lis = []
for i in range(0, 11):
  num = int(input())
  if num % 2 == 0:
    lis.append(num)
    
Question 2)
Ans:

List Comprehension:
There are 2 main things while working with Python Lista.
They are:  Index and Methods

A python list is mutable that is we can change of modify it.
We can access it's individual elements by index.

The first element is of index 0, the second of index 1, the third of index 2 and so on...
for example:
lis = [1,2,3,4]
Here, the element at index 0 is 1
The element at index 1 is 2...

We can access it's element using index in this way:

list_name[index_number]

This is the element!

Next we can also change it's elements at the certin index!

For example:
list_name[index_number] = the_new_number


Next we will discuss about list methods!

Here are a few important list methods:


append()
clear()
copy()
count()
extend()
index()
insert()
pop()
remove()
reverse()
sort()


We can apply these methods on a list by using this statement:

list_name.method_name(values[if_any])


This was a short intro to ist omprehension...



Question 3)
Ans:

n= int(input())

dic = {}
for i in range(0, n+1, 1):
  dic[i] = i * i
  
print(dic)



Question 4)
Ans:


import math
d = int(input())
if d == 1:
  dir = int(input("UP"))
  print(round(dir))
  
if d == 2:
  one = int(input("UP"))
  two = int(input("Down"))
  
  if one > two:
    print(round(one - two))
  if two > one:
    print(round(two - one))
  else:
    print(0)
    
if d == 3:
  one = int(input("UP"))
  two = int(input("Down"))
  three = int(input("LEFT"))
  
  if one > two:
    i = one - two
  if two > one:
    i = two = one
  if one == two:
    i = 0
    
  u = i*i
  l = three * three
  if i == 0:
    print(round(three))
  else:
    print(round(math.sqrt(u + l)))
  
  if d == 4:
    one = int(input("UP"))
    two = int(input("Down"))
    three = int(input("LEFT"))
    four = int(input("RIGHT"))
    
    if one > two:
      i = one - two
    if two > one:
      i = two - one
    if one == two:
      i = 0
      
    if three > four:
      u = three - four
    if four > three:
      u = four - three
    if three == four:
      u = 0
      
if i == 0:
  if three > four:
      u = three - four
    if four > three:
      u = four - three
    if three == four:
      u = 0
      
  print(round(u))
  
if u == 0:
  if one > two:
    i = one - two
  if two > one:
    i = two - one
  if one == two:
    i = 0
      
  print(round(i))
  
if i > u:
  print(round(math.sqrt((i*i) - (u*u))))
  
if u > i:
  print(round(math.sqrt((u*u) - (i*i))))
  
else:
  print("INVALID")
